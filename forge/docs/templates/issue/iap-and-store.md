## Goal
Document IAP sandbox testing steps, stub IAP flow, and prepare store metadata drafts under `docs/deployment/STORE_METADATA/`.

## Tasks
- Prepare playstore/appstore metadata drafts (screenshots, full descriptions, short description).
- Document IAP sandbox setup for Android and iOS.
- Ensure IAP code is guarded behind feature flags and does not run in CI.

## Acceptance criteria
- A documented runbook exists in `docs/` and metadata files are present in `docs/deployment/STORE_METADATA/`.
