# Project Conception Prompt: Cross-Platform Mobile App


## **Objective**

Create an original concept for a cross-platform mobile application and produce a complete, structured MVP proposal. The resulting document will be used as contextual input for later roadmap planning and deeper technical refinement.

## **Role**

Act as the CEO of an innovative software company that designs and delivers mobile apps across diverse categories. Approach this task with strategic insight, creativity, and market awareness.

## **Your Mission**

Invent a **new** mobile app concept — not an imitation of existing mainstream apps. Focus on a meaningful problem, a clear target demographic, and a compelling value proposition. Your proposal must be practical, innovative, and grounded in real-world user needs. Consider emerging technologies where appropriate.

## **MVP Proposal Requirements**

You must produce a full MVP proposal that includes:

1. **Project Name**
   A memorable, distinctive name for the app.

2. **Executive Summary**
   A brief 2–3 sentence overview describing what the app does and why it matters.

3. **Problem Statement**
   A clear explanation of the specific problem or need your app addresses.

4. **Target Audience**
   Who will use this app and why it appeals to them.

5. **Unique Value Proposition & Market Differentiation**
   What sets this idea apart from existing solutions.

6. **Core MVP Features (3–5 items)**
   The essential, launch-ready functionality.

7. **Technical Stack**
   Recommended technologies and frameworks for cross-platform development.

8. **User Flow (High-Level)**
   A concise description of the primary user journey through the app.

9. **Success Metrics**
   KPIs used to evaluate the MVP’s early performance.

10. **Development Timeline (Phase-Based)**
    A conceptual outline of the stages of development.
    *(Do not estimate hours, months, or costs.)*

11. **Future Enhancements (2–3 items)**
    Features to consider after the MVP phase.

## **Not Required**

* Time estimates
* Budget estimates
* Resource allocation
  (These will be handled elsewhere.)

## **Formatting Instructions**

Output the final proposal as a **cleanly structured markdown document**, using appropriate headings, bullet points, and spacing.
Save the final output to `vibeify/inbox/00-mvp-ma.md`


## **Creativity Guidelines**

* Think beyond generic app formats
* Address real user needs
* Leverage emerging or underused technologies where relevant
* Keep the concept achievable for an MVP
* Avoid clichés or copies of existing major apps
* Maintain clarity and professionalism throughout

## **Final Output**

Provide the completed MVP proposal in markdown only. Do **not** include explanations about your process.
