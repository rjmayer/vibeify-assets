# Project Roadmap Generation Prompt

## Objective
Generate a comprehensive project roadmap with major milestones based on an existing MVC (Minimum Viable Concept) Project Proposal.

## Instructions

You are tasked with creating a detailed project roadmap that outlines the key phases and milestones for bringing a project from conception to launch. Please follow these steps:

1. **Review the MVC Proposal**: Carefully read and analyze the existing MVC Project Proposal located at `mvc.md` in the project structure. Understand:
   - The project's core concept and objectives
   - Target features and functionality
   - Technical requirements and constraints
   - Success criteria and goals

2. **Develop the Roadmap**: Create a structured roadmap that includes:
   - **Overview**: Brief summary of the project and roadmap purpose
   - **Phase Breakdown**: Organize the project into logical phases (e.g., Planning, Development, Testing, Launch)
   - **Major Milestones**: For each phase, identify 3-5 significant milestones that represent concrete achievements
   - **Timeline Estimates**: Provide realistic time estimates for each phase and milestone
   - **Dependencies**: Note any dependencies between milestones or phases
   - **Key Deliverables**: Specify what will be completed at each milestone
   - **Resource Requirements**: Identify team members, tools, or resources needed
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Highlight potential risks and mitigation strategies for critical milestones
   - **Success Metrics**: Define how progress and completion will be measured

3. **Save the Roadmap**: Save your complete roadmap in markdown format at `prototype/ai/output/docs/roadmap.md`

## Output Format

The output should be a well-structured markdown document that provides a clear, actionable roadmap. Use:
- Hierarchical headings for organization
- Tables or lists for milestone tracking
- Visual clarity through proper formatting
- Professional tone suitable for stakeholder review

## Roadmap Guidelines

- Be realistic about timelines and resource requirements
- Ensure milestones are specific, measurable, and achievable
- Consider technical dependencies and logical sequencing
- Include buffer time for unexpected challenges
- Align all milestones with the original project vision from the MVC proposal
- Focus on value delivery at each phase
