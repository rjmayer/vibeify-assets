# Project Conception Prompt: Cross-Platform Mobile App

## Objective
Conceive a random project idea for a cross-platform mobile app and create a comprehensive MVP (Minimum Viable Product) proposal.

## Instructions

You are tasked with creating an innovative mobile application concept. Please follow these steps:

1. **Generate a Creative Concept**: Come up with an original idea for a cross-platform mobile application. Consider:
   - A specific problem or need the app addresses
   - Target audience and user demographics
   - Unique value proposition
   - Market differentiation

2. **Create an MVP Proposal**: Develop a detailed MVP proposal that includes:
   - **Project Name**: A catchy, memorable name for the application
   - **Executive Summary**: Brief overview (2-3 sentences) of what the app does
   - **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the problem being solved
   - **Target Audience**: Who will use this app and why
   - **Core Features**: List of 3-5 essential features for the MVP
   - **Technical Stack**: Suggested technologies for cross-platform development (e.g., React Native, Flutter, etc.)
   - **User Flow**: High-level description of how users will interact with the app
   - **Success Metrics**: Key performance indicators to measure MVP success
   - **Development Timeline**: Estimated phases and timeframes for MVP development
   - **Future Enhancements**: 2-3 features to consider for post-MVP releases

3. **Save the Proposal**: Save your complete MVP proposal in markdown format at `docs/inbox/mvp.md`

## Output Format

The output should be a well-structured markdown document that is clear, professional, and ready for technical review. Use appropriate headings, bullet points, and formatting to ensure readability.

## Creativity Guidelines

- Think outside the box - don't just replicate existing popular apps
- Consider emerging technologies and trends
- Focus on practical problems that affect real users
- Ensure the concept is achievable within reasonable MVP constraints
